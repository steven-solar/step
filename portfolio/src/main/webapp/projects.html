              I joined several other students in developing Algotree, a website that seeks to gameify the technical interview preparation process.
              In my role I worked on frontend development, as well as building the curriculum and organization of the problems and explanations available to users.
              I developed style guides and outlines for the team, and wrote modules for Binary Search and Linked List problems.
              The platform is far from finished, but check out our alpha!

              Last Summer, while working at SoKat.co, my two teammates and I developed an algorithm to automate deciding which federal grant applications should and should not be funded.
              We leveraged natural language processing techniques such as Bag of Words, POS tagging and Latent Semantic Indexing to extract data from the application text.
              This, combined this with "metadata" about the applications, was fed into our model which outputted predictions with a 95% F1 score.

              For a Hopkins-hosted accelerator I, along with a partner, developed the concept of Feed, a mobile application to reduce food waste by streamlining the food rescue process.
              We gained admission to the spark Accelerator, and won $1K. We spoke with restaurants, grocery stores andvisited soup kitchens to develop our idea.
              The Spark Accelerator brought in interesting, accomplished speakers and we were able to learn so much about entrepreneurship and the world of Venture Capital.
              Although we eventually realized it was infeasible due to regulation and health concerns, it was a great learning experience in developing a venture.

              While learning Java in high school, I discovered Java applets and had lots of fun exploring them.
              I built the games Snake and Pong to play on my computer, tracking high scores (per session) and outputting funny messages when I'd lose.
